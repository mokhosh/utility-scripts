Some scripts to help me automate the boring stuff

# What's included?
`move.rb` moves all mp4 files that are in subfolders to the root folder where the script is located.

`durations.py` collects the duration of all mp4 files in current directory and save them in a txt file.

`edit.rb` cuts the first 5 seconds of each mp4 file and make it 5 seconds shorter based on durations.txt file provided by `durations.py` and puts the result in a subfolder called `cut` so you have to have that.
